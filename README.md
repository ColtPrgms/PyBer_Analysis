# PyBer_Analysis
##### Bootcamp - Challenge #5 - PyBer_Ride_Share

### Overview
    The goal was to preform an analysis based on the types of citys (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) that PyBer operates in to assist in improving busisness stratagies. 

### Results
    The overall analysis showed that Urban citys have a significantly higher number of drivers, rides and fares when compared to Suburban and Rural city types. Rural cities have a higher average fare than Suburban and Urban city types, but Urban cities have the highest sum of fares when compared to the other city types. The following graphs are the visual results of the analysis.

### Summary
    After reviewing the results there are a couple of business reccomendations to offer. The first is focusing on a quantity approach. While the average fare is higher per ride in Rural cities, the total sum for fares is higher in Urban cities from January '19 to April '19. Also Urban cities have 68.4% of total rides compared to Rural which has only 5.3%. From this analysis it is recommended that having more rides regardless of fare amount provides increase revenue. 
    Secondly, the results show a model of supply versus demand. Rural cities have 2.6% of total drivers but have an average fare of about $37(usd) per ride. Urban cities have 80.9% of total drivers but have an average fare of about $25(usd) per ride. Due to the lack of drivers in rural cities the fares are a higher rate than urban cities which have a large amount of drivers. If PyBer was to limit the number of avaliable drivers based on urban city's population to lessen the supply with the same amount of demand, while maintaining adequate coverage of services, the average fare rate would increase per ride.
